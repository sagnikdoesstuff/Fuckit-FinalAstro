## The Scope

Built a Health Services platform from a ground-up, where the providers (clinics, labs, hospitals etc.) have their autonomy to create their custom packages & host it on the platform.

## My role

As a sole designer responsible for this project, I led both the providers & the users challenges. While my other teammates are simultaneously building the Products section of the e-commerce platform, I also have to keep equal attention to how that’ll impact the Services module. I conducted user research for providers & patients. I produced wireframes, user flows & mockups. I created a design system for the wireframes & hi-fidelity mockups, that’ll be instrumental in developing the final design. I supervised the development of both front & back end.

## Step 1 : The Why **(Business)**

DOC has an existing system which is very rigid & manual. The legacy system is controlled by the in-house health providers. The process rudimentary at its best. Business justification for the why we’re doing it was to give the power of creation to the Providers themselves. Thus automating the whole process.

**Current Process :** The clinics gives the description of their different packages & it’s contents over a Google sheet & emails to the Healthcare division. Then DOC admin then inputs the contents & builds a package through the CMS.

**Updated Process :** The providers creates an account on the DOC platform. Then they can bulid their own packages with a list of items provided by DOC. The item list is a vast collection, in case there some item missing, the providers can request it to add it to the collection, through the platform.

## Step 2 : The Acceptance **(Business & Me)**

After business came up with the idea, the next step for me was to make sure that enough Providers are going to accept the new process. So, I along with business people went to the top providers & discussed about the process. 

I designed the process flow & showed them. Paper prototypes were shared to show the intended screens & how to’s. I interviewed around 15 different providers, out of that 12 were enthusiastic about the new process, while the other were a bit apprehensive. 

They were happy that, they won’t have to wait for us (the bottleneck) for creating & editing their products. I told them that we’ll guide them through the process & initial stages after we develop the platform, that gave them added confidence.

## Step 3 : Solving problems

**#Problem 1 - Creating & Publishing your custom package**

Working with our in-house Subject Matter Experts (SME) & the clinics to come up with an optimum solution to create packages. DOC admin defines the basic items, the providers picks those items & build their packages. The providers has the ability to name the package, price, edit, adding add-ons etc. If the items doesn’t exist, put in a request to Admin to add it to the database.

**#Problem 2 - Bulk upload feature for uploading packages**

After we tested the package upload module with the clinics, they raised a new concern. Some of the clinics had a huge number of packages to upload. They wanted a feature where they can bulk upload a whole catalogue of packages. Then I came back to the drawing board, to built the feature where the clinics/providers are given an Excel file, they need to fill the column details of each fields & upload the file.

**#Problem 3 - Item upload for the DOC admins**

I came up with the way to that the DOC admins will upload & catalogue the items. They can upload each individual item or do a bulk upload through an excel file.

## The Results

We shared a video of the process with the providers & told them that if they still have isssues DOC can further hand-hold them.

But to my surprise, even though the UI wasn’t as good as I wanted, only 10% providers came back to us for further hand-holding. 

Right now, while DOC is going through a UI design refresh, more providers are getting onboarded & multiplying the packages on the platform.

Not mentioned in detail are the other areas of the marketplace application, I was involved in. Namely **Redemption module**, **Commissions module, Discounts & Category management.**
