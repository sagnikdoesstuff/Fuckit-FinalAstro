## Objective

Rider Safety feature on the existing Ride Beam app.

## Competitive Research

All though not a competitive research per-se, I took cues from Waze. The ability of that app to guide the drivers to safe routes, making them aware of obstacles & getting feedback from other drivers is one of the best UX in that genre.

## Rider Safety Coach - RSC feature

RSC feature on the Beam app, starts right up the moment a prospective user scans the QR code.

I broke down the RSC feature in 3 different sections. Pre-ride, During & Post-ride. As in my many years of experience in riding motorcycles, I believe that the safety aspect of any ride, starts before you start the motorcycle & ends till you turn it off & park it.

Let’s break down the different sections…

**************************************************************************

### Pre-ride check

Rider should be able to go through a series of checklist, to know if they are physically & mentally capable of riding the scooter. For e.g. if the scooter is scanned on a Saturday night after 9pm, before unlocking the scooter, the app would present a quick sobriety test either in form of coordination or memory challenge. If the user fails the test, they will be given an option to book a car ride. Lumosity has excellent tests, for cognitive & neuropathic functions.

I wrote up some scenarios, which will RSC will activate based on location, day/time & conditions.

**Headphones (Bluetooth) :** I noticed quite a few times that the riders are wearing headphones while riding. We can pair the headphones to send out voice alerts to the riders.

**************************************************************************

### During ride

This part of ride is very tricky. While you don’t want to distract the rider, but the rider should also know if they are following the safest route or they are going beyond recommended speed limits etc. 

Alerts on the app should be designed such that, though not so distracting that the rider needs to take their focus off the road, but still notices the alert & possibly fix their riding style.

Some of the alerts that the rider should get on the app, while they are continuing their ride…

### Post ride

![Super wide](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F4bd16f6e-36db-4b3f-af20-d91ad16b74d4%2FScreen_Shot_2022-09-10_at_11.29.19_AM.png?id=4b18e90c-76a5-4097-b248-1649bd0d5c0f&table=block&spaceId=68b90edf-4a11-4efa-b8c7-74466f3700b6&width=2000&userId=79fb7369-6524-4f63-a09f-770a1c45036e&cache=v2)


The post ride feature of RSC, relies heavily on gamification. Awarding & cutting points on the rider’s style of riding. Also, RSC will let the rider know where to park the scooter (safe & city regulated), thus making the lives of other people better. 

Taking a cue from Uber (not sure about Lyft) there will be a Ratings system, which not only the rider can give feedback on the scooter & other features, but the app will give a detailed statistics on the rider’s overall journey. The feedback should be in educative, constructive & motivated format, that’ll encourage the rider to do better for their next ride.

I’ve tried to keep the design very simple. The main aim is to not to distract the rider so much that they have to stare at the phone for the alerts & notifications. The alerts & notifications are separated in two different visual modes.

Primary Color: The main CTA’s are in BEAM primary.

Font used is SF Pro.

## How to enable RSC feature on the Beam app

The RSC feature can be achieved by using Telematics program, which will collect real-time data on the riders driving habit. There are two main types of trackers available. One is a physical telematics device (dongle) that’ll be installed on the scooters & the other one is through the Beam app.
