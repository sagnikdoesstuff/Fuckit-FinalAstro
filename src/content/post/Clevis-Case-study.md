# Clevis - Case study

> Market research, User Personas, Wireframes & Hi-Fidelity mocks
> 

### **The Task**

- Build stronger relationship between existing customers & Clevis.
- Reach new audiences.
- Come up with a new value proposition that blurs the lines between the physical and digital store experience.

### **The Team**

Our CX team consist of Project manager, UX researcher & me mainly on design. At times we take inputs & help out the staff from the physical store, in setting up & displaying the merchandise.

### **Phase 1 : Discovery**

In this initial phase, we study our users. Omnichannel shoppers are more valuable than customers who only engage with your brand in one place. In fact, surveys show they spend an average of 4% more in physical stores and 10% more online compared to customers who only shop online or who only shop in-store. Plus, the more channels you engage your customers on, the better.

### **Creating User Personas**

A customer or buyer persona is a generalized representation of your target customer. It usually includes information on your customers’ demographics, behaviors, motivations, and goals.

In order to achieve our value proposition, we needed at least 3 different types of user personas. One that’s shops online only, one that shops online & in physical store & one that’s shops only at a physical store.

Luckily, I had in my close proximity, 3 individuals who fulfills these different personas. I’ve changed the names, so that my wife (3rd persona) doesn’t know, I’m using her as a research object.

## **2. Identify User Needs**

Once I’ve charted my customer’s goals, actions, and frustrations for each phase, I can design a map or timeline to visualize the journey. Mapping your customer journey shows how to make your customer experience more consistent and personalized. This way you can get inside their heads and try to see things from their perspective. This will help me address my customers needs and pain points in a better way. When I know what the gaps are in your customer experience, you can actually take action to fill them.I consider this part to be one that drives the whole UX, of the website.

Here I, in this exercise, just mapped one of my user persona’s experience, but I kept the pain points of my other personas as well.

## **3. User Flow**

I consider user flow like painting with big brush making shapes instead of getting into details. If you get the shapes perfect, you’re done with 70% of your painting.

This is a user-flow of my target persona. I tried to figure out all her pain-points, from ideation to completion & envision the flow & then figure out the details in mockup phase

## ****Phase 2 : Solving UX through Design****

### **1. Pencil Sketches**

It’s the first exercise, I do prior to getting on Sketch or XD. Gives me an idea, about components.

In my “Competitive analysis” study, I went through a bunch of retail websites, that I think has some of the best UX. I studied the case studies, of those websites, & tried to create some opportunities out of the already tested themes.

### **2. Hi-Res Prototyping**

The tool used in the clickable prototyping is Adobe XD. Though I’m pretty new, using this tool, I love it so far.

I start by creating the Product page first, as that’s the page my user is gonna land on after she scans the QR code. My aim is to make the page cover all the pain points.

### **UX Challenges**

- The product hero image is not one but four. Shows 4 different aspects of the apparel. Thus making the choice easier for the user. They don’t have to flip through for the other looks.
- The product description on the right, addresses pain-points of our users. They can talk to the representative about any doubts, thus getting personal care/touch. They have an option to browse similar products or even find that product in store. They have a quick glimpse of the shipping charge and other delivery options.
- In doubt, user can browse through the user generated content from social media.
- Option to browse through a range of curated accessories that pair up with the apparel
